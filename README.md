# Spotify Data Pipeline Portfolio Project

This GitHub repository showcases a data engineering project I completed to automate the extraction and processing of trending song data from Spotify for India. The project highlights key skills and technologies I utilized, including:

- Python for data extraction with the Spotipy library.
- AWS Lambda functions for automation.
- Event-driven architecture with Amazon EventBridge.
- Snowpipe for data loading into Snowflake.
- Power BI for data visualization.

The pipeline runs daily, ensuring up-to-date insights into the Indian music scene. Feel free to explore the code and configurations to understand the technical aspects of this project.
